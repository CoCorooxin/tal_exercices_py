evaluation taggers

This piece of code aims to evaluate the performance of a pos-tagger(you can find the tagger in tagger.tar), using various parameters. More pythonic code is possible but here I only provides a basic version of how this task can be done in python.

The sample evaluation is based on the data set of three files  ---the train-corpus used by the tagger(train.conllu) is from https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html, the test corpus fr_gsd-ud-test.conllufr_gsd-ud-test.conllu is also from the site. And the result of the pos-tagger(output.json)  in the form of list of dictionaries.

I didn't write the python codes inside the tagger. 

The link to the tagger is following
